# Yelp Dataset

This is an IPython notebook I'm using to do some exploratory analysis using the Python data stack (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, etc.)

## Installation

You can start by doing what I did, which was downloading the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads "Anaconda Distro" ) distribution of Python or something comparable. Actually the first thing I tried to do was compile all of the pydata libraries themselves, which turned out to be as much fun as it sounds. Anaconda is nice because it has all of those libraries built in and ready to go, along with IPython, where I've been doing my analysis for this dataset.

## Usage

As is fairly obvious, this file is in IPython notebook format. It can be used as an example and springboard for continuing this type of analysis in the IPython (or regular Python) environment. The JSON files are in their original format from the [Yelp Dataset Challenge](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge), where you can find more info about the k,v pairs and parameters for the challenge itself.

At this point, I haven't set this up as a package, although at some point it would be cool to set this up as an interactive web app with some visualization. I am planning on continuing this type of analysis, with the probable next steps of text/NLP analysis of the review bodies, including tf-idf for similarity ranking. I'd also like to do a time-series analysis of the check-ins. As you can see from the code, I haven't even touched those parts yet.
